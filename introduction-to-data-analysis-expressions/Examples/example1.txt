1 - Calculated column - takes up space.  This is called the row context.

NetSale = Sales[Quantity] * Sales[Unit Price]

Total Sales Column = SUM(Sales[NetSale])

context.  Based on how the application is filtering the data.

Total Sales Iterator = SUMX ( Sales, Sales[Quantity] * Sales[Unit Price] )
