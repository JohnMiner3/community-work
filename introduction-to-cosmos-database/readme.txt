Topic:

Introduction to Azure Cosmos Database


Abstract:

Azure Cosmos database is Microsoft’s new globally distributed, multi-model database service. While there is support for four different application programming interfaces today, we are going to use the SQL API to manage documents store that uses the JSON format.

During this session, we will be covering the object hierarchy that is used to group and manage documents. We will talk about the different ways to load data into the Not Only SQL (NoSQL) database. Security can be implemented at many different levels when deploying the service. JavaScript can be used to extend the database with stored procedures, triggers and functions. Last but not least, we will talk about dynamic reporting using Power BI, the Cosmos DB connector and SQL queries.

In short, you will have a good understanding of Cosmos database by the end of the session.
