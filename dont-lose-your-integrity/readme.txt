Topic:

Don’t lose your integrity


Abstract:

This is a lightning talk covering database integrity.

I will be covering these various T-SQL techniques to enforce database integrity. A toy databases called AUTOS will be implemented two ways: one without integrity and one with integrity. The issues with the first design will be examined and corrected with the second design.


Coverage:

1 – Primary Keys.
2 – Foreign Keys.
3 – Unique constraints.
4 – Check constraints.
5 – Default constraints.
6 – Data type constraints.
7 – DML Triggers.
