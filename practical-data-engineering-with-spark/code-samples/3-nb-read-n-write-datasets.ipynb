I used it 1-2 times, and that's it.  It IS heavy; not so much that you're lifting weights, but it IS weighted; I don't see why this is a good thing.  So if you have delicate curls and tiny knots, you can easily break off your curls instead of combing through them with the extra weight; so you have to use extra care with this comb.  And that's just it; this comb isn't meant for small curls.  Each tooth of the comb is thick, so if you're prone to tiny knots, this comb definitely won't work through them...unless destruction equates detangling...if the the hair is gone, then you're definitely knot-free!Also, the teeth are not staggered on each side of the comb; they're just copied/paralleled. So whatever hair you just combed gets combed again in the same place.  If the teeth were staggered, it would be more effective.I would only use this comb if my hair was already tangle-free/knot free, there wouldn't be a problem with small knots.  But if you have big curls, then maybe the comb will work well for you.  My curls are 3C with some 3B, ~3/8 of an inch in diameter; they make ringlets or ripples depending on the product (or lack of) in my hair.  Especially with small ringlets/tendrils, I need smaller teeth to comb through them.I used bakelite/bone combs and a Denman brush; the smaller the knot, the smaller the teeth that I use.  In fact, I don't see why anyone would even need a tangle-teezer when a denman brush can achieve the same results if you use lighter pressure...but maybe I should try one, a TT that is?And then, there's the old finger combing when my hair is unbearably knotty...in more ways than one!  ;-\"Behave hair, beHAVE!\"  \"Tame the mane!\"But my routine 1x-2x a week is to...1)finger comb - tiny knots/or for just QUICK detangling and then SKIPPING steps 2-4!2)bone comb - regular knots3)denman brush - brush out loose, dead hair; stimulate scalp.4)regular sized bone comb (wider space between teeth w/ bigger teeth) - comb all hair in the style/direction that I  want it to dry in.Not all curly hair is created equal...nor are all knots.

I looked at the otterbox case but it got pretty awful reviews so I ended up getting this one instead. It turned out to be a great purchase. It only took me a minute or two to put it on and it holds together very well. There's some slight squeaking of the plastic along the right side in one area on mine that occurs whenever you pick the iPad up but it doesn't really bother me. The only downside of this case, which some of the other reviews have pointed out, is that the silicon part covering the home button sticks occasionally. In order to make it click the actual home button again you have to pry that silicon piece up and then gently push it back in. Overall this isn't that big of a deal for me because it only sticks every now and again and it takes a whole of half a second to fix it but it is a slightly annoying occurrence for such an expensive case. It does add substantial weight but that kind of goes with this kind of case's territory. Even with its few problems it gives me piece of mind about potentially dropping it (even though I haven't do to the grippy covering) which is all I really wanted in an iPad case.Also, A+ for Gumdrop customer service. I sent them an email about the home button sticking and 10 minutes later they emailed me back.

Before you start mounting it, it is a good idea to take the brackets with you to test the fit of the screws, especially the locking screws.- The tighter the brackets are, the tighter the fit is (you want them tight). To mount, lock the brackets together and align the edge of the &#34;keyhole&#34; bracket with the edge of the board.

I suspect this bottle last forever...well maybe not considering I use it for everything and on everything..lol. I'm a Castile Soap user for life!I looked up some uses for Castile Soap, here's what I found:1. Shampoo: Use castile soap as a stand-in for a harsh detergent-based shampoo. Give your head a break! Just mix castile soap with water at a ratio of 1:3.2. Laundry Detergent: You can make your own laundry detergent with simple, common ingredients. Save tons money and do the environment a friendly favor. It's a win-win! [...]3. Tub Scrub: Make a tile or toilet \"soft scrub\" out of baking soda and castile soap. Simply fill a spray bottle with a dilution of 1:3 castile to water. Sprinkling the area you wish to clean with a liberal dusting of baking soda, then spray the castile solution over the top. Scour with a sponge or scrub brush and watch the stains disappear. This also works great on crusty stovetops!4. Mopping Solution: Use 2 or 3 tablespoons of castile soap in a full bucket of water, and mop mop mop your floors to a sparkly new luster.5. Dish Soap: Make a dishwashing soap (for hand washing) or a liquid hand soap (for washing hands) by simply mixing a 1:1 ratio of castile to water.6. Dishwasher Detergent:  Make a fancier DIY liquid dishwasher detergent that's inexpensive and eco-friendly.7. Soap Dispenser Refill: You can refill your foaming hand soap dispenser with 1 part castile soap to 4 parts water.8. Body Wash: You can use castile soap as a gentle yet efficient bath soap/body wash. They actually sell castile bar soap, but if you want to use the liquid just dilute it in a 2:1 ratio of castile:water.9. Dog Shampoo: What's good enough for you is even better for your pet! Use the same ratio listed above for an awesome DIY doggie shampoo.10. Toothpaste: You can actually use castile soap in place of your toothpaste, and pure soap is much better for your teeth than the nasty chemicals they put in most commercial pastes. Just add a few drops directly to your wet brush. It works wonders, although the flavor can take some getting used to!11. Veggie Wash: Make a simple veggie wash for cleansing all your produce. Add 1 tablespoon castile soap to 2 cups of water, and keep the mixture in a squirt bottle near the kitchen sink.12. Carpet Cleaner: Finally, you can make an effective carpet cleaner by mixing  cup castile into 1 cup water. Place the solution in the blender and let it fly until it forms a stiff foam. Apply as you would any other carpet cleaning product.",1360108800,"Dr. Bronner 18-in-1 Pure-Castile Soap, Hemp Almond - 16 fl oz","A3CB6SPAINUHOW"],["B003IZBHYW","BELKIN",[0,0],"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41T7CXLlwBL._SY300_.jpg",24.49,3.0,"This product was bought to improve upon an existing router and result was the same, no improvement.

I think the majority of Staind's core fans want to hear something loud and heavy....if you're one of those fans, this album probably isn't for you. This album sounds more along the lines of past tunes such as &quot;Fade&quot;, &quot;Waste&quot; and &quot;Epiphany&quot;. The album's first single, &quot;Price To Play&quot; is an awesome, catchy little song but it's probably as heavy as the album gets. Generally I'd be disappointed if a hard rock band put out a more mellow album, but when I first listend to this CD, I found myself singing along by the end of every song. Some of the other great songs include &quot;Zoe Jane&quot;, &quot;How About You&quot; and &quot;Layne&quot;, which is about the late Layne Staley (singer of Alice In Chains). I can't tell you how interesting it is to hear this song, because they recorded it as if it were an AIC song, with the haunting harmonization and bluesy notes and everything. It just goes to show just how great of song-writers the guys in Staind really are.

It's derived from a part of the botanical called \"lavendula latifolia.\"Oil Of Spike Lavender can be very useful as a solvent in making your own oil painting mediums. It dries more slowly than Odorless Mineral Spirits (OMS) and significantly more slowly than turpentine. Because its solvent action is stronger than turpentine and much stronger than OMS, it is able to form a better bond with your previous layers of paint -- but you do have to be careful that it doesn't lift your underlying oil paint layers. It creates a slicker, more-workable characteristic in the painting mediums that I prepare.  I use a mix of Oil of Spike Lavender, either Damar Varnish or Copal Varnish, and either stand oil or sun-thickened oil (the type of varnish and oil used as well as the ratio of the three ingredients depends on whether I'm painting fat or lean layers).  While I do use plain turpentine often in my painting, I find the smell of the Oil of Spike Lavender to be much more pleasant.

I bought it *Only* for the programmability, so if you are thinking of buying this for gaming, you may want to skip this review. :-)Now, there are programs that will store keyboard macros.  The issue with those programs is that, with hundreds of programs, having different functionality, there are simply not enough keyboard \"shortcuts\" to go around (using the standard keyboard key combinations).  I wanted *ONE* dedicated key for each operation.There are also separate programmable \"Keypads\" that you can buy, but I really could not spare the desktop real estate.  Also the largest of these keypads has about 24 keys, with this keyboard you can have 36 macros. (12 keys x 3 modes)PROS:- You can get up and running with your macros in only a few minutes.- I always thought that Illuminated Keyboards were a novelty, but not anymore; this feature is great in low-light environments.- There are 12 dedicated keys, but 3 macro \"Modes\", making it possible to have 36 macros.- You can insert a TextFile as a Macro.  This is a great feature, as many time you have text that you commonly use (Disclaimers, Signatures, Opening/closing statements, ...ect), that are in text form, or are too long to be retyped as macros.  As far as I can tell, this great feature is not advertised.;-)- The ability to decide if you want the recorded Macros to be stored/played back with or without the actual keyboarding delays.- Relatively easy to reassign the keysCONS:- No PC power control keys (Shutdown, Sleep, Wakeup, ...etc)- You can't readily change a Textfile Macro into a \"Recorded\" macro, (and vice versa)- For me the Tab keystrokes in the TextFile Macros did not work exactly the same in MS Programming environments VBA, VB6.  Multiple Tabs would seem to \"Stack\" when indenting code (This is difficult to reproduce here, ...to solve this, I simply \"recorded\" the textfile)- For me the small screen was difficult to program.  I really did not need it anyway, so I just use it as a Clock.- No available options for creating/ordering custom key caps.- Because you do not have customizable key caps, you may have to constantly call up the taskbar app to see what your keystrokes do (until you start to memorize them over time.)- It is not inherently obvious how to edit recorded Macros. It can be done, but the macro seems to \"double\" each keystroke. (KeyDown, KeyUp?)- No \"Big\" Enter key.INDIFFERENT:Multi color backlightingMultimedia controls.Keyboard mini-screen\"Gaming\" modeSpare USB portsCONCLUSIONIf you need the ability to record and playback keystrokes, this is a great keyboard.If you are a big-time gamer, it is probably worth much more to you.In my humble opinion, it is well worth the $200.00USD.JeffCoachman",1258502400,"Logitech G19 Programmable Gaming Keyboard with Color Display","A2FIKW8IAEJM0F"],["B000H740UM","Keebler",[0,0],"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51QNq3hYvXL._SX300_.jpg",27.48,4.0,"These 100 calorie packs are perfect for those watching their weight and taste just fantastic.The only down side is that there is too much packaging for the amount of food in the box.

I cannot even imagine how that could happen. Maybe if the child was way too young to usethese (or incredibly undernourished!) and the parents yanked like crazy people!

Burton is maturing a lot from his earlier escapades and is no longer being weird for the sake of being weird, but instead tries to tell a story- there is nothing I hate more than directors who are too busy being artists to tell a story - must be why I don't like European films that much. Sleepy Hollow, on the other hand, is probably Burton's best film, because though he changes Washington Irving's original story quite a bit, he does such a good job of it that most people shouldn't or won't care. That and the film, the acting, the sets- everything look so darn good, that one can't help but to enjoy this retelling of one of America's first fairy tale.Johnny Depp (From Hell), who I must admit to being somewhat of a fan of, stars as Icabod Crane, a constable from New York City who is sent by a judge (Christopher Lee) to this Dutch farming village up north to investigate a series of grisly murders. Crane is a man of science who eschews religious faith in favor of rational thought and the scientific method, except he seems to be making it up as he goes along. When it's explained to him that these murders to committed by a headless Hessian mercenary from America's Revolutionary days, he naturally blows off the possibility, until he sees it for himself. There have been better on-screen epiphanies, but few end up with heads rolling into the hero's lap or cowering in a bed and hauling the covers up over one's head like a five year old. Depp's performance is wonderful, bringing to mind an absent minded professor who succeeds inspite of himself.Burton crafts everything perfectly- the village is the usual gothic weird- Sleepy Hollow becomes Gotham City with its tightly packed, narrow buildings. Colors are muted- greys, greens, browns and black is enhanced, giving the film a Dickensian dream-like quality. Christina Ricci (who may be one of the most beautiful women alive) plays Katrina Van Tassel, the unlikely heir to her father's fortunes and an `I think for myself' woman and secretly a witch in this deeply religious town. She falls for Icabod until his `science' and deductive reasoning leads him to believe that it is she who controls the Horseman (played by Christopher Walken). I found the underlying plot of the film- the reason why the Horseman is killing all of these people, very pleasing. So many movies these days like to cover the motivations of their villains in high minded ideals, but in Sleepy Hollow's case, it's good old fashioned greed, spite and revenge.Miranda Richardson (sigh!) appears as Katrina's retiring, helpful step mother and an instrument of pure evil, for it is she who possesses the Hessian's skull and who drives the Horsemen to commit these ghastly murders. Knocking off members of the community who are listed in the Van Tassel estate until she becomes the sole heir to her husband's fortune and this done because her own family had been treated so poorly by the Van Tassel's when she was a little girl. See? Good, honest motivations- greed, spite, revenge! And she sets about bumping off the likes of Ian McDiarmid (Attack of the Clones), Martin Landau (Ed Wood), and Richard Griffiths (the abusive step-father from the Harry Potter films), and better decapitations have not been seen in a movie in a long time! Burton's casting of this film could not have been better- everyone is superb in their roles. Even the loathsome Casper Van Dien (Starship Troopers), but since he gets pureed, I can live with it.At its core, Sleepy Hollow is a tongue-in-cheek action film, complete with chases, a grand explosion, sword fights and gun battles. But everything is so seamlessly crafted that it carries the viewer along. The Hessian is like the Terminator- a relentless, indefatigable killing machine, driven by his own desires to recover his head, but helpless under the power of its wielder. It has lots of atmosphere and manages to be genuinely creepy at times, even providing a few scares- something truly hard to accomplish in a film these days.

I purchased theSamsung Chromebook (Wi-Fi, 11.6-Inch). For the price, it's a fantastic little laptop.My school purchased 30 Chromebooks and because my students have access to them I've gone 100% digital this quarter. The Google \"software\" does everything I need it to do:**Google Drive** :: Yes, it takes time (and lots of YouTubing/internet research) to figure out how to share folders but once I figured it out --- OH MY GOODNESS --- my teaching life changed. My students and I use Drive to store our work. They share their files with me and I can easily read/comment/edit/grade. We've even scheduled virtual conferences on their GDoc! I also use GForm to create a modified gradebook; students \"turnin\" their assignment via the GForm, copying/pasting the URL of their document. On my end, I see a Google Sheet (similar to Excel) where I see the information they wrote. I click on the link, read/comment on their ideas, then head back to the Sheet where I add another two columns, one for their grade and the other for my comments. No more paperwork, no more carrying huge bags. My Drive is organized, color-coded, and manageable. I'm a big fan.**Google Sites** :: I create my classroom website using Google Sites and it works beautifully for my purpose and audience. Again, it's not as intuitive but there are a ton of YouTube and GDoc tutorials. My students have complete access to all the files/folders we use in class. I've synced my Google Calendar on my site too.**Chromebook itself** :: Like the other reviewers noted, the laptop wakes/boots up super fast (&lt;10 seconds), which I love. My old Macbook Pro took FOREVER to start up (then again, it's really old). Google Chrome syncs all my bookmarks (which I have a TON) too. I prefer to use Chrome over Firefox or IE or Safari. And the laptop is fast. I've opened 12+ tabs w/o delay. The volume isn't too bad; but then again, I'm not a consistent music/video streamer. Oh, and the 6-8 hr battery life is divine for the classroom.**Chrome webstore** :: It's growing and that's nice. I've added many of my favorite apps (e.g. Dropbox, Minesweeper, Evernote, Pandora, EasyBib) and have pinned the few I use consistently on my launcher.**OVERALL** :: My students and I collaborate on the Chromebooks three times a week and so far, it's been a positive experience. I've even had four seniors purchase their own Chromebooks for college. Yes, there are kinks and this laptop isn't a traditional laptop, but for the price and what it's able to do in my teaching classroom, the Samsung Chromebook is perfect.",1364774400,"Samsung Chromebook (Wi-Fi, 11.6-Inch) 2012 Model","A23CYACX9LBHTQ"],["B001M9GCNM","GODLYKE",[0,0],"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41Z1-U0mg4L._SY300_.jpg",7.5,5.0,"Item was shipped relatively fast, works perfectly. the wire is not as durable as I would like but for the price it does what it's supposed to do very well.",1271116800,"Godlyke Power-All System C-5/R 5-Connector Right Angle Daisy Chain Cable Black","A12FLEINXJYQGF"],["B00172M8HS","Sony",[0,0],"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/21XsofUyTBL.jpg",12.93,4.0,"still working fine as of July 2014; I think we've had for 1 1/2 yrs...work great for trips, especially after we bouth a splitter for the ipad so 2 of these can plug in",1404864000,"Sony MDR-222KD Children's Headphones (Pink)","A1AHGG3P2VLCYS"],["B008C5LK9K","Generic",[0,0],"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51l36bXJcRL._SY300_.jpg",5.63,4.0,"Really nice cover.

I know there are already a sea of reviews on this so product so I will just add my Pros and Cons and be short and sweet.First off, I did not give this 5 stars.  For me, it is a sold 4 star product.  Where did the 1 star I held back go you may be asking?  Fair question.  When the device arm is more \"out\" than \"up\" it really does kick up vibrations!  I've got a 2011 vehicle and yeah there is going to be some shaking and what not, but at times it is so bad that the screen is hard to look at.  I know what the problem is and I'm pretty sure I can reinforce it enough to cut this down quite a bit, but there is just not enough support for the device with the weight of the phone in it when in an extended position to help remove the severe vibrations.If you place your phone in it in the position of the product picture - well it works great and you only get subtle vibrations.  My dash is far enough back where I have to position it where the arm appears to more extended.  I have not tried it on the windshield yet as I need to find a good spot that won't impair my field of view.Other than that, and it may just be me, I love it.Once you put this thing in place, it is not moving.  I love how you can adjust so many different parts of the arm. (iOttie - a good feature to include would be something that would allow you to swivel it a horizontal direction without the need to lift the suction, turn it, and then re-apply the suction.)If you are looking for a window mount or a dash mount this really is the one to get.

This was less than $24.00 ! I was thinking there's no way this is going to work and especially for under $24. I almost bought a Springer but keep hearing reviews saying the leash can come unattached and I didn't like that at all. I have a mini schnauzer and a BIG Golden Retriever baby. My mini Schnauzer has always been so good on the bike he just runs beside the handle bars and I hold his leash between my hand and the handle bar. My Golden is HYPER and crazy and pulls HARD. lol. She's young. I could feel her pull on the Pyramid leash but not has hard as I thought it would feel...that wasn't the problem. I didn't like how her neck got jerked so hard when she wasn't on queue....which she hardly ever is because she is a floppy crazy hyper puppy. ..so I replaced the leash with a regular ol' bungee cord I got from Wal-Mart and these two little metal clips that only cost $3 at Wal-Mart. I rigged it on the bike by using plyers to make circles out of the hooks on the end of the bungee cords. I also added a PetsMart doggie seatbelt loop just to make the leash longer. If you couldn't find this you could so easily make one. I've had to do that before. The bungee makes it to where there is just a little quick jerk on her neck and she gets back into place. I am going to post a link and I hope Amazon will show it. I think it will be VERY helpful. Works great. I'm soooo GLAD I bought this. I had to use chicken to entice my dog to stay on the right side because that is where I want her. The way my bike is made the attachment will only go on the left side and yet she can still be on my right side. Every now and then if she comes too close to the bike I can feel the bungee cord rubbing the tire just a little bit...no problem.

After using it, I decided to replace my other three Dropcam HD cameras and sell them, and I purchased three more of these cameras.I have an extensive amount of crap in my house that runs on the 2.4 GHz network. I have many Phillips Hue lightbulbs that run that 2.4 Ghz frequency and seem to interfere with the Dropcam HD units that I have found my placement has to be very careful. With the new model, I can run on the 5 GHz network in my house and I have no major issues. So this alone is a great update.I find the sound is clearer as well and the speaker louder in the Pro model as well. But by far the greatest improvement is in the image quality. Even in good light, the new model far outpaces the old one in detail, and color quality. The Dropcam HD has a nasty problem of not rendering colors correctly due to it's infrared filter. This new camera doesn't have any of those problems. Color is spot on, And looks exactly like it looks in real life. The amount of resultant detail is also much higher, even in bright light. And the low light capability is worlds better; a single street lamp is enough to light up my whole street with the new model and I can even see the clouds in the night sky. That's very impressive.There was a reason that you can zoom the new model to eight times magnification versus four times magnification on the old HD version. It's because there's just so much more detail. And the new zoom and enhance feature, which is of course available on the old model now thanks to a very nice firmware update, allows you to get even more detail. I am able to zoom out and see 1/16 of the frame enhanced to quite usable high-definition detail which is something I was never able to see before. I am now able to point the camera out the window, at a large view of the street, and be able to see details such as a car approaching and so forth, the model of the car, and if they get close enough even the license plate. This is a huge update from the old model, which you couldn't do any of that with.Combine the sharpness improvements with a wider field of view, and you have a winner. You can simply cover more area with one camera. But the improvements don't stop there. You can also see much greater movement detail than before. With the old model, movements (temporal information) would sometimes be jerky, Or leave trails. With the Pro camera you get much smoother movement through the frame, and thus can make out more.In fact my only complaint is that you can't store any of this data locally. The cameras I have nearly exceed the bandwidth cap Comcast allowed before they suspended the cap. I'm not sure what direction they're going to go in, they may use the Arizona model and give me a much more bandwidth because I run at the highest tier. However if that is not the case, I will have to purchase a business account just to keep up with the bandwidth that these cameras suck down. Sure, you can reduce the quality of the upload, and you can shut the cameras off at certain times of the day. But if you really want full coverage, be prepared to use over 60 GB per month per camera.  I haven't had it long enough, but I suspect the pro model will use even more data because it resolves so much more detail in the frame. I do wish there was a way to locally store this video, because some people just won't be able to handle the bandwidth limitations.If you can work within the bandwidth limitations, I think there's no question that the pro model offers significant improvements over the HD model if you need to see any kind of realistic color, or detail in your images. If you were just looking at your pets, or just looking at a baby, the HD model is more than enough. But if you're using these cameras for any kind of security application, you owe it to yourself to get this higher-end model so that you can see exactly what's going on in and around the area that you care about the most detail possible. I am very familiar with commercial CCTV systems, and this little camera offers a lot more quality than many of those systems. You have to pay top dollar to get anything approaching the quality you get from these cameras, and much more money to exceed them.",1381708800,"Dropcam Pro Wi-Fi Wireless Video Monitoring Camera","A9TUK03C1K76R"],["B001UBNRH6","Connaisseur",[0,0],"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/21E-4EUB1BL.jpg",7.99,5.0,"At first glance,I thought that they were too big to fit in my Proctor Silex coffeemaker,but it turned out to be just the right size.

Of course, I also purchased the Bridge to go with the system.  I purchased 2 of the play:5 speakers, and 2 of the Play:3 speakers.*** Setup ***As many others have said, the initial setup was very easy.  I use a Dlink DIR-555 router and did not need to make any changes to the setup to support the Sonos system.  The only issue I had was connecting one of the Play:3 speakers to the system.  It would not join.  I was quickly able to find the factory reset instructions after which it joined the system just fine.  I also use a Macbook pro and HTC EVO 4G as controllers.  No problem with either (I have not upgraded my Macbook to Lion yet).The controller interface on both the Macbook and Android was a little awkward at first.  Almost an early 2000's type user interface.  The Android software is missing some functionality, but overall, its ok, and after a couple days, easy to use.  I think the Android version of controller was just released recently, so I'm sure it will catch up in functionality soon.*** Music Services ***Right now, I only use Spotify.  My other music service is Slacker Radio, which is not yet supported on Sonos.  Spotify setup and integration was a non-issue.  Quick and easy (I already had a premium account).  The quality with Spotify is very good.  However, I've been busy creating playlists on Spotify.  Unfortunately, about 50% of the tracks in the playlists are unavailable when played through Sonos.  If I search for the tracks directly using the Sonos user interface, I find the track and can play it.  For some reason, many/most of the tracks do not play from a playlist.  This really is irritating and significantly reduces the usefulness of the very promising combination.  Both companies have made a splash about supporting the other...they need to work together to find a fix very quickly.*** Overall functionality ***In our 3 days of using the system, my wife and I are very pleased overall.  We have a Play:3 setup in our master bathroom, a pair of Play:5's in our Master bedroom, and the other Play:3 in our living room.  It has been very nice playing music in multiple rooms and controlling from my phone.  I've tried a few of the internet radio stations and they work really well.  We've also enjoyed moving one of the Play:5's from our bedroom to the kitchen and other parts of the house.  That part is awesome!*** Sound Quality ***I'm no audiophile.  In my master bedroom, I previously had a Bose Wave Radio 2.  In my family room, I have a decent 7.1 surround sound system driven by an Onkyo A/V receiver paired with fairly decent speakers (can't remember the brand/model right as I'm typing this).  I also frequently use a nice pair of in-ear headphones, which probably give the best overall sound.  I have not been much of a music collector...I have maybe a few hundred songs accumulated over the years.  Most of these are ripped from CD's as I refuse to purchase MP3's with the current state of the music industry and DRM lock-in.  Thus when we play music, I either connect my phone with Slacker Radio or local MP3's directly to my Bose or A/V system.  Both acceptable.After reading the reviews for the Sonos, I had very high expectations for sound quality.  Perhaps inflated expectations is the problem.  But considering the cost of the system, high expectations are not unreasonable.  Unfortunately, the sound quality is just not there.  The overall experience is really good, but after 3 days, I'm getting more disappointed with the sound quality.  When paired together as a stereo pair, the Play:5's in our master bedroom are decent.  The lows and highs are acceptable.  Like someone else mentioned, there is a strange quality to the EQ settings for this system.  Perhaps it would be better if there were more EQ tuning options.  The system only has a Bass and Treble slider to mess with, which is not adequate.  Compared to my Bose, the 2 Play:5's paired together sound better.  Larger fuller sound.  However, if I unpair the speakers and use just one of the Play:5's, the sound is on par with the much smaller Bose system.  In fact, I think the Bose has a better high range than the Sonos.  The sound is not bad.  I'm sure someone will compare the sound/price to the Bose, which is fair.  However, I expected much more.  Another reviewer suggested getting a Z120 with external speakers is a better option and I have to say that is probably the better way to go for sound quality.In the bathroom, the single Play:3 is in vertical orientation and placed a few inches from the wall.  The wall does provide a much better bass response, so that is not the problem.  The problem is that these sound like background PA system speakers rather than nice audio speakers.  The sound is very focused on the midrange.  Even with the bass set all the way down and treble all the way up in the EQ settings, the upper mid's and high end range is just not there.  Since little speakers usually suffer from bad bass, my feeling is that Sonos really tuned these for lower ranges at the expense of the high ranges.  Have you ever been to a restaurant playing background music  (not live music) though a PA type system?  That is what these sound like.  The other day, I had some nice upbeat jazz playing while we were getting ready for a wedding.  As muted background music, these a fine, but that's about it.  I have a pair of outdoor Bose speakers in my pool area that are similar in size.  The Bose speakers are about the same depth and maybe a little longer.  The Bose are driven from my Onkyo A/V system and sound much, much better that the Sonos speakers.One final note on sound quality.  I have Slacker radio on my phone and have the subscription service that allows me to cache stations to my phone.  The common complaint is that cached stations on Slacker stream only at 60kbps - very low quality sound.  I tried connecting my phone to the input on one of the Play:5 systems and played a cached station.  I can't tell any noticeable difference between that and a 360kbps song playing from Spotify.  In my car, which has a nice audio system, playing a cached Slacker station sounds muddled.  In contrast, a downloaded track from Spotify sound like a CD, which is a notable difference in sound quality.  Unfortunately, the sound quality on Sonos is not good enough to hear the difference.*** Conclusion ***We love the functionality, but not the sound.  I'm going to play with the system a little more, but right now I'm leaning towards returning the components to Amazon.  Now that I know what full-house wireless sound is like, I'll start looking for alternatives.  Perhaps a good alternative is using Sonos 120's with external speakers, but that will be a little less convenient and more money.  I wonder what can be done with Apple Airplay?",1314489600,"SONOS - PLAY:5 Wireless Speaker for Streaming Music (Large) -  White","A35KSV240RW1J0"],["B005PUSL8S","Rogz",[0,0],"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41QgScFBMFL._SY300_.jpg",16.06,5.0,"Works really good when you have the kind of dogs with no necks.i have 3 pugs and THIER neck is bigger then THIER head.",1360627200,"Rogz Utility Medium 5/8-Inch Reflective Snake Adjustable Dog Step-in-Harness, Lime","AWDVZ98Z7IAXL"],["B00A4346VM","MPERO",[0,0],"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41lTtN59JkL._SY300_.jpg",8.95,5.0,"I will recommend this to anyone who needs this product.

I made my own training gear using a piece of 2&#34; x 2&#34; x 5/8&#34; piece of hardwood for the hub and 5/16&#34; dowels for the rods.  I reused the balls that came in this kit.  I quickly ran a 5/16 drill through the balls and they fitted securely on the ends of the dowels.  It works great and I've since had some extremely hard landings, but the wooden training gear doesn't break.  I paid just over $3.00 for this gear, so in my opinion, the balls are worth it.  It beats having to buy plastic balls and drilling/mounting them to the ends of the dowels.  That's why I give it 3 stars.  Just don't buy this expecting it to handle a moderate landing.",1356652800,"US Ship Rc Helicopter Training Gear for Trex 450 and Clone, Blade 400, 450 Helis","A2D9RWCQX318J2"],["B004D32HMO","Shoreline",[1,2],"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/118H71nbyLL._SY300_.jpg",23.34,5.0,"Feels heavier and better than other oars I have purchased online.

I used it 1-2 times, and that's it.  It IS heavy; not so much that you're lifting weights, but it IS weighted; I don't see why this is a good thing.  So if you have delicate curls and tiny knots, you can easily break off your curls instead of combing through them with the extra weight; so you have to use extra care with this comb.  And that's just it; this comb isn't meant for small curls.  Each tooth of the comb is thick, so if you're prone to tiny knots, this comb definitely won't work through them...unless destruction equates detangling...if the the hair is gone, then you're definitely knot-free!Also, the teeth are not staggered on each side of the comb; they're just copied/paralleled. So whatever hair you just combed gets combed again in the same place.  If the teeth were staggered, it would be more effective.I would only use this comb if my hair was already tangle-free/knot free, there wouldn't be a problem with small knots.  But if you have big curls, then maybe the comb will work well for you.  My curls are 3C with some 3B, ~3/8 of an inch in diameter; they make ringlets or ripples depending on the product (or lack of) in my hair.  Especially with small ringlets/tendrils, I need smaller teeth to comb through them.I used bakelite/bone combs and a Denman brush; the smaller the knot, the smaller the teeth that I use.  In fact, I don't see why anyone would even need a tangle-teezer when a denman brush can achieve the same results if you use lighter pressure...but maybe I should try one, a TT that is?And then, there's the old finger combing when my hair is unbearably knotty...in more ways than one!  ;-\"Behave hair, beHAVE!\"  \"Tame the mane!\"But my routine 1x-2x a week is to...1)finger comb - tiny knots/or for just QUICK detangling and then SKIPPING steps 2-4!2)bone comb - regular knots3)denman brush - brush out loose, dead hair; stimulate scalp.4)regular sized bone comb (wider space between teeth w/ bigger teeth) - comb all hair in the style/direction that I  want it to dry in.Not all curly hair is created equal...nor are all knots.

I looked at the otterbox case but it got pretty awful reviews so I ended up getting this one instead. It turned out to be a great purchase. It only took me a minute or two to put it on and it holds together very well. There's some slight squeaking of the plastic along the right side in one area on mine that occurs whenever you pick the iPad up but it doesn't really bother me. The only downside of this case, which some of the other reviews have pointed out, is that the silicon part covering the home button sticks occasionally. In order to make it click the actual home button again you have to pry that silicon piece up and then gently push it back in. Overall this isn't that big of a deal for me because it only sticks every now and again and it takes a whole of half a second to fix it but it is a slightly annoying occurrence for such an expensive case. It does add substantial weight but that kind of goes with this kind of case's territory. Even with its few problems it gives me piece of mind about potentially dropping it (even though I haven't do to the grippy covering) which is all I really wanted in an iPad case.Also, A+ for Gumdrop customer service. I sent them an email about the home button sticking and 10 minutes later they emailed me back. They're releasing a version 2 of this case that fixes the home button sticking issue, (on August 28th I believe),  and are sending me one to replace the one I have.</td><td>1311292800</td><td>Gumdrop Cases Drop Tech Series Case for Apple iPad 2- Black-Black</td><td>A15BCIDJNLIALL</td></tr><tr><td>B003BQ6QXK</td><td>ToiletTree Products</td><td>List(0, 0)</td><td>http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/411rroTN2FL._SY300_.jpg</td><td>29.95</td><td>4.0</td><td>A little annoying to install at first but worth the time.You do have to fill with water for each use and then dump out the water but it works great.</td><td>1359244800</td><td>Fogless Shower Mirror with Squeegee by ToiletTree Products.

Why they are there we are not sure but remember, dogs should always be supervised when in the pool and if your dog is not a swimmer you might want to look into a life vest as well.

Before you start mounting it, it is a good idea to take the brackets with you to test the fit of the screws, especially the locking screws.- The tighter the brackets are, the tighter the fit is (you want them tight). To mount, lock the brackets together and align the edge of the &#34;keyhole&#34; bracket with the edge of the board. The product picture is misleading, as the &#34;key&#34; bracket should be further from the edge of the board.Overall, I would pick this set over the button type brackets.</td><td>1387238400</td><td>Galvanized Steel Bed Rail Fasteners</td><td>A2VG02V8HAKRT</td></tr><tr><td>B00G8JECSI</td><td>Loomy Bands</td><td>List(0, 0)</td><td>http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51tUdq3ceXL._SX300_.jpg</td><td>19.95</td><td>5.0</td><td>This was a great buy!!

Now we each put on a crown and laugh and play and she tells me about her birthday and trips to the zoo.  This has opened up a new world for me and my family, what a blessing.  I am able to adjust the camera to the angle I need.  I was able to hold the camera facing my screen so my son could help me set up Skype and the sound and video cam settings, and the webcam sits on the top of my slender screen.  This Webcam is what I was hoping for.  I have not tried to record with it yet, I will have to look into that, it has so many capabilities.

I suspect this bottle last forever...well maybe not considering I use it for everything and on everything..lol. I'm a Castile Soap user for life!I looked up some uses for Castile Soap, here's what I found:1. Shampoo: Use castile soap as a stand-in for a harsh detergent-based shampoo. Give your head a break! Just mix castile soap with water at a ratio of 1:3.2. Laundry Detergent: You can make your own laundry detergent with simple, common ingredients. Save tons money and do the environment a friendly favor. It's a win-win! [...]3. Tub Scrub: Make a tile or toilet \"soft scrub\" out of baking soda and castile soap. Simply fill a spray bottle with a dilution of 1:3 castile to water. Sprinkling the area you wish to clean with a liberal dusting of baking soda, then spray the castile solution over the top. Scour with a sponge or scrub brush and watch the stains disappear. This also works great on crusty stovetops!4. Mopping Solution: Use 2 or 3 tablespoons of castile soap in a full bucket of water, and mop mop mop your floors to a sparkly new luster.5. Dish Soap: Make a dishwashing soap (for hand washing) or a liquid hand soap (for washing hands) by simply mixing a 1:1 ratio of castile to water.6. Dishwasher Detergent:  Make a fancier DIY liquid dishwasher detergent that's inexpensive and eco-friendly.7. Soap Dispenser Refill: You can refill your foaming hand soap dispenser with 1 part castile soap to 4 parts water.8. Body Wash: You can use castile soap as a gentle yet efficient bath soap/body wash. They actually sell castile bar soap, but if you want to use the liquid just dilute it in a 2:1 ratio of castile:water.9. Dog Shampoo: What's good enough for you is even better for your pet! Use the same ratio listed above for an awesome DIY doggie shampoo.10. Toothpaste: You can actually use castile soap in place of your toothpaste, and pure soap is much better for your teeth than the nasty chemicals they put in most commercial pastes. Just add a few drops directly to your wet brush. It works wonders, although the flavor can take some getting used to!11. Veggie Wash: Make a simple veggie wash for cleansing all your produce. Add 1 tablespoon castile soap to 2 cups of water, and keep the mixture in a squirt bottle near the kitchen sink.12. Carpet Cleaner: Finally, you can make an effective carpet cleaner by mixing  cup castile into 1 cup water. Place the solution in the blender and let it fly until it forms a stiff foam. Apply as you would any other carpet cleaning product.</td><td>1360108800</td><td>Dr. Bronner 18-in-1 Pure-Castile Soap, Hemp Almond - 16 fl oz</td><td>A3CB6SPAINUHOW</td></tr><tr><td>B003IZBHYW</td><td>BELKIN</td><td>List(0, 0)</td><td>http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41T7CXLlwBL._SY300_.jpg</td><td>24.49</td><td>3.0</td><td>This product was bought to improve upon an existing router and result was the same, no improvement.

Now on &quot;14 Shades Of Grey&quot;, they've put out an even MORE radio-friendly album. I think the majority of Staind's core fans want to hear something loud and heavy....if you're one of those fans, this album probably isn't for you. This album sounds more along the lines of past tunes such as &quot;Fade&quot;, &quot;Waste&quot; and &quot;Epiphany&quot;. The album's first single, &quot;Price To Play&quot; is an awesome, catchy little song but it's probably as heavy as the album gets. Generally I'd be disappointed if a hard rock band put out a more mellow album, but when I first listend to this CD, I found myself singing along by the end of every song. Some of the other great songs include &quot;Zoe Jane&quot;, &quot;How About You&quot; and &quot;Layne&quot;, which is about the late Layne Staley (singer of Alice In Chains). I can't tell you how interesting it is to hear this song, because they recorded it as if it were an AIC song, with the haunting harmonization and bluesy notes and everything. It just goes to show just how great of song-writers the guys in Staind really are. So it may not be that heavy, or sound too similar to &quot;Break The Cycle&quot;, but as far as I'm concerned it's a good album and I'll be listening to it a lot this summer!</td><td>1053475200</td><td>14 Shades of Grey (with Limited Edition Bonus DVD)</td><td>AYSLSU7966FWE</td></tr><tr><td>0788812807</td><td>SportsTronics</td><td>List(0, 0)</td><td>http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51WGYVH00PL._SY300_.jpg</td><td>3.95</td><td>4.0</td><td>Love this film... my daughter does too... only thing was the disc was not secure in the case and arrived floating all over the case.

And, if kept cold, they work great.  But once you take them out of the refrigerator, they warm up quickly.  If you are looking for something to keep your insulin cool while its out of the refrigerator but indoors or for a very short time outside, then this might work for you.  If you are looking to keep your insulin chilled for 6-8 hours, I would look elsewhere.  I will go back to using my Medicool.  I can put that in my backpack and still have cold insulin at dinnertime.

But within 2 months of using this vac, I noticed as high-pitched whine and significantly reduced suction.  I discovered the hepa filter had literally collapsed and was stopping the air from flowing.  I went online to get a new filter and this model requires you to REPLACE THE ENTIRE HEPA FILTER (PLASTIC AND ALL)!!  What??!?  The woman and the vac repair shop said she hates this model and gets a lot of unhappy customers coming to her for hepa replacements.  Anyway, the filter is NOT SOLD AT LOCAL STORES (I bought the vac at Target), so I had to special order it, which took 2 weeks.I put the new hepa filter in 3 weeks ago and the suction came back for about a week.  Now, I'm back to poor suction.

It's derived from a part of the botanical called \"lavendula latifolia.\"Oil Of Spike Lavender can be very useful as a solvent in making your own oil painting mediums. It dries more slowly than Odorless Mineral Spirits (OMS) and significantly more slowly than turpentine. Because its solvent action is stronger than turpentine and much stronger than OMS, it is able to form a better bond with your previous layers of paint -- but you do have to be careful that it doesn't lift your underlying oil paint layers. It creates a slicker, more-workable characteristic in the painting mediums that I prepare.  I use a mix of Oil of Spike Lavender, either Damar Varnish or Copal Varnish, and either stand oil or sun-thickened oil (the type of varnish and oil used as well as the ratio of the three ingredients depends on whether I'm painting fat or lean layers).  While I do use plain turpentine often in my painting, I find the smell of the Oil of Spike Lavender to be much more pleasant.  Just be careful with how aggressive it is.I've found that the Oil of Spike Lavender works even better than turpentine in removing stubborn bits of resin from my brushes when cleaning them.</td><td>1393113600</td><td>Lefranc &amp; Bourgeois Oil of Spike Lavender 75 ml Bottle</td><td>A2IDRAYYZ5GKBZ</td></tr><tr><td>B00009R8NY</td><td>MCS</td><td>List(3, 6)</td><td>http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/21Fvy9nGAzL.jpg</td><td>5.9</td><td>5.0</td><td>1.

People will remember you just because they like the way you smell! A little goes a long way and I have used other body sprays like BBW Brown Sugar and Fig or Twilight Woods on my clothes with the perfume on my wrists and neck.  Men will follow you around!

I bought it *Only* for the programmability, so if you are thinking of buying this for gaming, you may want to skip this review. :-)Now, there are programs that will store keyboard macros.  The issue with those programs is that, with hundreds of programs, having different functionality, there are simply not enough keyboard \"shortcuts\" to go around (using the standard keyboard key combinations).  I wanted *ONE* dedicated key for each operation.There are also separate programmable \"Keypads\" that you can buy, but I really could not spare the desktop real estate.  Also the largest of these keypads has about 24 keys, with this keyboard you can have 36 macros. (12 keys x 3 modes)PROS:- You can get up and running with your macros in only a few minutes.- I always thought that Illuminated Keyboards were a novelty, but not anymore; this feature is great in low-light environments.- There are 12 dedicated keys, but 3 macro \"Modes\", making it possible to have 36 macros.- You can insert a TextFile as a Macro.  This is a great feature, as many time you have text that you commonly use (Disclaimers, Signatures, Opening/closing statements, ...ect), that are in text form, or are too long to be retyped as macros.  As far as I can tell, this great feature is not advertised.;-)- The ability to decide if you want the recorded Macros to be stored/played back with or without the actual keyboarding delays.- Relatively easy to reassign the keysCONS:- No PC power control keys (Shutdown, Sleep, Wakeup, ...etc)- You can't readily change a Textfile Macro into a \"Recorded\" macro, (and vice versa)- For me the Tab keystrokes in the TextFile Macros did not work exactly the same in MS Programming environments VBA, VB6.  Multiple Tabs would seem to \"Stack\" when indenting code (This is difficult to reproduce here, ...to solve this, I simply \"recorded\" the textfile)- For me the small screen was difficult to program.  I really did not need it anyway, so I just use it as a Clock.- No available options for creating/ordering custom key caps.- Because you do not have customizable key caps, you may have to constantly call up the taskbar app to see what your keystrokes do (until you start to memorize them over time.)- It is not inherently obvious how to edit recorded Macros. It can be done, but the macro seems to \"double\" each keystroke. (KeyDown, KeyUp?)- No \"Big\" Enter key.INDIFFERENT:Multi color backlightingMultimedia controls.Keyboard mini-screen\"Gaming\" modeSpare USB portsCONCLUSIONIf you need the ability to record and playback keystrokes, this is a great keyboard.If you are a big-time gamer, it is probably worth much more to you.In my humble opinion, it is well worth the $200.00USD.JeffCoachman</td><td>1258502400</td><td>Logitech G19 Programmable Gaming Keyboard with Color Display</td><td>A2FIKW8IAEJM0F</td></tr><tr><td>B000H740UM</td><td>Keebler</td><td>List(0, 0)</td><td>http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51QNq3hYvXL._SX300_.jpg</td><td>27.48</td><td>4.0</td><td>These 100 calorie packs are perfect for those watching their weight and taste just fantastic.The only down side is that there is too much packaging for the amount of food in the box.

Rubberized handle is comfortable and does a good job of staying in your hand with a full swing and reducing impact injury. Only downside I found was the steel insert in the base/bottom of the handle are sharp teeth... maybe good for combatives with zombies, but not for use as a hammer, and might cause yourself scraps and cuts that could become hazardous when in the field, especially in a survival situation. I'd suggest dremmling or filing this down a bit if you will be using this primarily as a camp/survival tool.The case is a low-medium quality/design solution: foam padded nylon cover, plastic insert for saw top, velcro closure around handle (marginal security), no drainhole, belt loop is soft nylon with a single stitch line on each side (likely to break under heavy field conditions). If you want to \"ranger\" this  out, I'd suggest you restitch or replace the belt loop, drill a few drain holes, sew on a good nylon strap/snap solution for retention, and wrap the whole thing in your favorite color of 550 Cord and/or duct tape and create a few much need lashing points.

When things got too heated, they were told to go outin the backyard with these and \"work things out\".  They are inflatable plastic gloves. As long as they arenot inflated too hard, they don't really hurt anyone. Most of the time, the kids ended up laughing too much toinflict any harm.I was reading a few of the other reviews, and was amazed that someone said they had pulled a child's armout of the socket. I cannot even imagine how that could happen. Maybe if the child was way too young to usethese (or incredibly undernourished!) and the parents yanked like crazy people!  Your hands will sweat a littlewhen you use them - that's normal - it's plastic. But a simple way to get them off if they seem stuck is - wait forit - open the air valve and let some air out!  Tah-dah! I hope I've saved a child's arm now.The original toys were well-made. We were cleaning out old closets and found an original set. They still inflatedeasily and worked just fine! We have a little newsprint on one of the gloves from being packed in a box ofwhatever for almost a decade. Reading here, it would seem the newer \"socker boppers\" are not made as well, andleak easily. I can't vouch for that, since I don't have a set of the new ones, only the older style ones.Over all, these are a relatively harmless way for kids to get out some energy. Don't inflate them too hard, becauseit could hurt a little if it is hard as a rock.  Most people are not going to do that - it'll be up to the parentsto check on how the kiddos are inflating/using them.(For those of us who grew up in a non-PC (politically correct) world, isn't it amazing that we have survivedSock'em Boppers, Duncan Yo-Yos (with a broken vase or two), Kabonkers (oh, the bruises I had on my arms!), and skatesthat were halfway screwed on to your oldest tennis shoes.

Burton is maturing a lot from his earlier escapades and is no longer being weird for the sake of being weird, but instead tries to tell a story- there is nothing I hate more than directors who are too busy being artists to tell a story - must be why I don't like European films that much. Sleepy Hollow, on the other hand, is probably Burton's best film, because though he changes Washington Irving's original story quite a bit, he does such a good job of it that most people shouldn't or won't care. That and the film, the acting, the sets- everything look so darn good, that one can't help but to enjoy this retelling of one of America's first fairy tale.Johnny Depp (From Hell), who I must admit to being somewhat of a fan of, stars as Icabod Crane, a constable from New York City who is sent by a judge (Christopher Lee) to this Dutch farming village up north to investigate a series of grisly murders. Crane is a man of science who eschews religious faith in favor of rational thought and the scientific method, except he seems to be making it up as he goes along. When it's explained to him that these murders to committed by a headless Hessian mercenary from America's Revolutionary days, he naturally blows off the possibility, until he sees it for himself. There have been better on-screen epiphanies, but few end up with heads rolling into the hero's lap or cowering in a bed and hauling the covers up over one's head like a five year old. Depp's performance is wonderful, bringing to mind an absent minded professor who succeeds inspite of himself.Burton crafts everything perfectly- the village is the usual gothic weird- Sleepy Hollow becomes Gotham City with its tightly packed, narrow buildings. Colors are muted- greys, greens, browns and black is enhanced, giving the film a Dickensian dream-like quality. Christina Ricci (who may be one of the most beautiful women alive) plays Katrina Van Tassel, the unlikely heir to her father's fortunes and an `I think for myself' woman and secretly a witch in this deeply religious town. She falls for Icabod until his `science' and deductive reasoning leads him to believe that it is she who controls the Horseman (played by Christopher Walken). I found the underlying plot of the film- the reason why the Horseman is killing all of these people, very pleasing. So many movies these days like to cover the motivations of their villains in high minded ideals, but in Sleepy Hollow's case, it's good old fashioned greed, spite and revenge.Miranda Richardson (sigh!) appears as Katrina's retiring, helpful step mother and an instrument of pure evil, for it is she who possesses the Hessian's skull and who drives the Horsemen to commit these ghastly murders. Knocking off members of the community who are listed in the Van Tassel estate until she becomes the sole heir to her husband's fortune and this done because her own family had been treated so poorly by the Van Tassel's when she was a little girl. See? Good, honest motivations- greed, spite, revenge! And she sets about bumping off the likes of Ian McDiarmid (Attack of the Clones), Martin Landau (Ed Wood), and Richard Griffiths (the abusive step-father from the Harry Potter films), and better decapitations have not been seen in a movie in a long time! Burton's casting of this film could not have been better- everyone is superb in their roles. Even the loathsome Casper Van Dien (Starship Troopers), but since he gets pureed, I can live with it.At its core, Sleepy Hollow is a tongue-in-cheek action film, complete with chases, a grand explosion, sword fights and gun battles. But everything is so seamlessly crafted that it carries the viewer along. The Hessian is like the Terminator- a relentless, indefatigable killing machine, driven by his own desires to recover his head, but helpless under the power of its wielder. It has lots of atmosphere and manages to be genuinely creepy at times, even providing a few scares- something truly hard to accomplish in a film these days. A good twist on an old tale by a director who is coming into his own.</td><td>1057881600</td><td>Sleepy Hollow</td><td>A11A8GWG0IXBZH</td></tr><tr><td>B008J13J96</td><td>NoviPet</td><td>List(0, 0)</td><td>http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41ZKc5vspML._SY300_.jpg</td><td>9.99</td><td>3.0</td><td>This supplement is easy to give to your dogs - it's a chewable treat.

I purchased theSamsung Chromebook (Wi-Fi, 11.6-Inch). For the price, it's a fantastic little laptop.My school purchased 30 Chromebooks and because my students have access to them I've gone 100% digital this quarter. The Google \"software\" does everything I need it to do:**Google Drive** :: Yes, it takes time (and lots of YouTubing/internet research) to figure out how to share folders but once I figured it out --- OH MY GOODNESS --- my teaching life changed. My students and I use Drive to store our work. They share their files with me and I can easily read/comment/edit/grade. We've even scheduled virtual conferences on their GDoc! I also use GForm to create a modified gradebook; students \"turnin\" their assignment via the GForm, copying/pasting the URL of their document. On my end, I see a Google Sheet (similar to Excel) where I see the information they wrote. I click on the link, read/comment on their ideas, then head back to the Sheet where I add another two columns, one for their grade and the other for my comments. No more paperwork, no more carrying huge bags. My Drive is organized, color-coded, and manageable. I'm a big fan.**Google Sites** :: I create my classroom website using Google Sites and it works beautifully for my purpose and audience. Again, it's not as intuitive but there are a ton of YouTube and GDoc tutorials. My students have complete access to all the files/folders we use in class. I've synced my Google Calendar on my site too.**Chromebook itself** :: Like the other reviewers noted, the laptop wakes/boots up super fast (&lt;10 seconds), which I love. My old Macbook Pro took FOREVER to start up (then again, it's really old). Google Chrome syncs all my bookmarks (which I have a TON) too. I prefer to use Chrome over Firefox or IE or Safari. And the laptop is fast. I've opened 12+ tabs w/o delay. The volume isn't too bad; but then again, I'm not a consistent music/video streamer. Oh, and the 6-8 hr battery life is divine for the classroom.**Chrome webstore** :: It's growing and that's nice. I've added many of my favorite apps (e.g. Dropbox, Minesweeper, Evernote, Pandora, EasyBib) and have pinned the few I use consistently on my launcher.**OVERALL** :: My students and I collaborate on the Chromebooks three times a week and so far, it's been a positive experience. I've even had four seniors purchase their own Chromebooks for college. Yes, there are kinks and this laptop isn't a traditional laptop, but for the price and what it's able to do in my teaching classroom, the Samsung Chromebook is perfect.</td><td>1364774400</td><td>Samsung Chromebook (Wi-Fi, 11.6-Inch) 2012 Model</td><td>A23CYACX9LBHTQ</td></tr><tr><td>B001M9GCNM</td><td>GODLYKE</td><td>List(0, 0)</td><td>http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41Z1-U0mg4L._SY300_.jpg</td><td>7.5</td><td>5.0</td><td>Item was shipped relatively fast, works perfectly. the wire is not as durable as I would like but for the price it does what it's supposed to do very well.</td><td>1271116800</td><td>Godlyke Power-All System C-5/R 5-Connector Right Angle Daisy Chain Cable Black</td><td>A12FLEINXJYQGF</td></tr><tr><td>B00172M8HS</td><td>Sony</td><td>List(0, 0)</td><td>http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/21XsofUyTBL.jpg</td><td>12.93</td><td>4.0</td><td>still working fine as of July 2014; I think we've had for 1 1/2 yrs...work great for trips, especially after we bouth a splitter for the ipad so 2 of these can plug in</td><td>1404864000</td><td>Sony MDR-222KD Children's Headphones (Pink)</td><td>A1AHGG3P2VLCYS</td></tr><tr><td>B008C5LK9K</td><td>Generic</td><td>List(0, 0)</td><td>http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51l36bXJcRL._SY300_.jpg</td><td>5.63</td><td>4.0</td><td>Really nice cover.

Schick products are less expensive, and the results are comparable or better than what we were getting with Gillette.This razor features a water activated moisturizing serum that allegedly prevents drying.  The curve sensing blades are made for the curves of a woman's body, minimizing skin irritation.  Hydro Silk refills can be used once the razor has reached its end-of-life.In use, the moisture dots and the blades (sharpness) last 5-6 days.  The razor glides along your skin smoothly such that you don't even know its shaving at times.  No lather is produced by the moisturizing silk, but it definitely moisturizes the skin as you shave.  A tiny suction cup is provided if you want to hang this in your shower.In my opinion, this seems to be a better choice than the Gillette Venus or Intuition.  It seems to provide a better shave than the Quattro.  In the end though, it comes down to personal choice.My only issue with the Schick line is I have gotten refills that were dull from time to time.

Because it does exactly what it's supposed to, it leaves my mouth clean feeling (after the bubbling dissipates) and noticeably whitens after a single use. Continued use = more whitening.

I know there are already a sea of reviews on this so product so I will just add my Pros and Cons and be short and sweet.First off, I did not give this 5 stars.  For me, it is a sold 4 star product.  Where did the 1 star I held back go you may be asking?  Fair question.  When the device arm is more \"out\" than \"up\" it really does kick up vibrations!  I've got a 2011 vehicle and yeah there is going to be some shaking and what not, but at times it is so bad that the screen is hard to look at.  I know what the problem is and I'm pretty sure I can reinforce it enough to cut this down quite a bit, but there is just not enough support for the device with the weight of the phone in it when in an extended position to help remove the severe vibrations.If you place your phone in it in the position of the product picture - well it works great and you only get subtle vibrations.  My dash is far enough back where I have to position it where the arm appears to more extended.  I have not tried it on the windshield yet as I need to find a good spot that won't impair my field of view.Other than that, and it may just be me, I love it.Once you put this thing in place, it is not moving.  I love how you can adjust so many different parts of the arm. (iOttie - a good feature to include would be something that would allow you to swivel it a horizontal direction without the need to lift the suction, turn it, and then re-apply the suction.)If you are looking for a window mount or a dash mount this really is the one to get.  Despite the vibration issue, I will be getting another for my girlfriend's car and a co-worker has already bought one based off my recommendation.Hope all this helps!</td><td>1349222400</td><td>iOttie HLCRIO102 One Touch Windshield Dashboard Universal Car Mount Holder for iPhone 4S/5/5S/5C, Galaxy S4/S3/S2, HTC One - Retail Packaging - Black</td><td>A2BQYX3VAC63X7</td></tr><tr><td>B00355K1YM</td><td>Archer Farms</td><td>List(1, 1)</td><td>http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/513asbSY1PL._SY300_.jpg</td><td>11.99</td><td>5.0</td><td>This is some of the best Oriental mix that I have ever tasted.

I agree with some of the other ratings in that the temp setting needs to be set on high in order for the coffee to stay hot.  As for the plastic taste coming from the hot water dispenser, I would have to agree.  It does this when first used.  I ran several full pots through it over several days even though I did not want hot water, just to break it in.  That seemed to work as I dont get that smell or taste of plastic any longer.  I gave 4 stars due to that and the inconvenient water access on the coffee maker side.  Other that that I am very pleased with it so far.

This was less than $24.00 ! I was thinking there's no way this is going to work and especially for under $24. I almost bought a Springer but keep hearing reviews saying the leash can come unattached and I didn't like that at all. I have a mini schnauzer and a BIG Golden Retriever baby. My mini Schnauzer has always been so good on the bike he just runs beside the handle bars and I hold his leash between my hand and the handle bar. My Golden is HYPER and crazy and pulls HARD. lol. She's young. I could feel her pull on the Pyramid leash but not has hard as I thought it would feel...that wasn't the problem. I didn't like how her neck got jerked so hard when she wasn't on queue....which she hardly ever is because she is a floppy crazy hyper puppy. ..so I replaced the leash with a regular ol' bungee cord I got from Wal-Mart and these two little metal clips that only cost $3 at Wal-Mart. I rigged it on the bike by using plyers to make circles out of the hooks on the end of the bungee cords. I also added a PetsMart doggie seatbelt loop just to make the leash longer. If you couldn't find this you could so easily make one. I've had to do that before. The bungee makes it to where there is just a little quick jerk on her neck and she gets back into place. I am going to post a link and I hope Amazon will show it. I think it will be VERY helpful. Works great. I'm soooo GLAD I bought this. I had to use chicken to entice my dog to stay on the right side because that is where I want her. The way my bike is made the attachment will only go on the left side and yet she can still be on my right side. Every now and then if she comes too close to the bike I can feel the bungee cord rubbing the tire just a little bit...no problem.

After using it, I decided to replace my other three Dropcam HD cameras and sell them, and I purchased three more of these cameras.I have an extensive amount of crap in my house that runs on the 2.4 GHz network. I have many Phillips Hue lightbulbs that run that 2.4 Ghz frequency and seem to interfere with the Dropcam HD units that I have found my placement has to be very careful. With the new model, I can run on the 5 GHz network in my house and I have no major issues. So this alone is a great update.I find the sound is clearer as well and the speaker louder in the Pro model as well. But by far the greatest improvement is in the image quality. Even in good light, the new model far outpaces the old one in detail, and color quality. The Dropcam HD has a nasty problem of not rendering colors correctly due to it's infrared filter. This new camera doesn't have any of those problems. Color is spot on, And looks exactly like it looks in real life. The amount of resultant detail is also much higher, even in bright light. And the low light capability is worlds better; a single street lamp is enough to light up my whole street with the new model and I can even see the clouds in the night sky. That's very impressive.There was a reason that you can zoom the new model to eight times magnification versus four times magnification on the old HD version. It's because there's just so much more detail. And the new zoom and enhance feature, which is of course available on the old model now thanks to a very nice firmware update, allows you to get even more detail. I am able to zoom out and see 1/16 of the frame enhanced to quite usable high-definition detail which is something I was never able to see before. I am now able to point the camera out the window, at a large view of the street, and be able to see details such as a car approaching and so forth, the model of the car, and if they get close enough even the license plate. This is a huge update from the old model, which you couldn't do any of that with.Combine the sharpness improvements with a wider field of view, and you have a winner. You can simply cover more area with one camera. But the improvements don't stop there. You can also see much greater movement detail than before. With the old model, movements (temporal information) would sometimes be jerky, Or leave trails. With the Pro camera you get much smoother movement through the frame, and thus can make out more.In fact my only complaint is that you can't store any of this data locally. The cameras I have nearly exceed the bandwidth cap Comcast allowed before they suspended the cap. I'm not sure what direction they're going to go in, they may use the Arizona model and give me a much more bandwidth because I run at the highest tier. However if that is not the case, I will have to purchase a business account just to keep up with the bandwidth that these cameras suck down. Sure, you can reduce the quality of the upload, and you can shut the cameras off at certain times of the day. But if you really want full coverage, be prepared to use over 60 GB per month per camera.  I haven't had it long enough, but I suspect the pro model will use even more data because it resolves so much more detail in the frame. I do wish there was a way to locally store this video, because some people just won't be able to handle the bandwidth limitations.If you can work within the bandwidth limitations, I think there's no question that the pro model offers significant improvements over the HD model if you need to see any kind of realistic color, or detail in your images. If you were just looking at your pets, or just looking at a baby, the HD model is more than enough. But if you're using these cameras for any kind of security application, you owe it to yourself to get this higher-end model so that you can see exactly what's going on in and around the area that you care about the most detail possible. I am very familiar with commercial CCTV systems, and this little camera offers a lot more quality than many of those systems. You have to pay top dollar to get anything approaching the quality you get from these cameras, and much more money to exceed them.</td><td>1381708800</td><td>Dropcam Pro Wi-Fi Wireless Video Monitoring Camera</td><td>A9TUK03C1K76R</td></tr><tr><td>B001UBNRH6</td><td>Connaisseur</td><td>List(0, 0)</td><td>http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/21E-4EUB1BL.jpg</td><td>7.99</td><td>5.0</td><td>At first glance,I thought that they were too big to fit in my Proctor Silex coffeemaker,but it turned out to be just the right size.

This improved it but it still does not grind easily.  We use it still, and it's a good tasting salt with great definition and almost subtle flavors - however, we can't use it as a day to day in the grinder due to the consistency issue.  Excellent for using on top of fresh baked bread and homemade bagels, and we use it to season finer cuts of meat, and other items which the salt is not intended to be an afterthought.We'll go through this and order a more traditional, harder sea salt to use in our grinder - but definitely purchase from Spice Lab again.

Of course, I also purchased the Bridge to go with the system.  I purchased 2 of the play:5 speakers, and 2 of the Play:3 speakers.*** Setup ***As many others have said, the initial setup was very easy.  I use a Dlink DIR-555 router and did not need to make any changes to the setup to support the Sonos system.  The only issue I had was connecting one of the Play:3 speakers to the system.  It would not join.  I was quickly able to find the factory reset instructions after which it joined the system just fine.  I also use a Macbook pro and HTC EVO 4G as controllers.  No problem with either (I have not upgraded my Macbook to Lion yet).The controller interface on both the Macbook and Android was a little awkward at first.  Almost an early 2000's type user interface.  The Android software is missing some functionality, but overall, its ok, and after a couple days, easy to use.  I think the Android version of controller was just released recently, so I'm sure it will catch up in functionality soon.*** Music Services ***Right now, I only use Spotify.  My other music service is Slacker Radio, which is not yet supported on Sonos.  Spotify setup and integration was a non-issue.  Quick and easy (I already had a premium account).  The quality with Spotify is very good.  However, I've been busy creating playlists on Spotify.  Unfortunately, about 50% of the tracks in the playlists are unavailable when played through Sonos.  If I search for the tracks directly using the Sonos user interface, I find the track and can play it.  For some reason, many/most of the tracks do not play from a playlist.  This really is irritating and significantly reduces the usefulness of the very promising combination.  Both companies have made a splash about supporting the other...they need to work together to find a fix very quickly.*** Overall functionality ***In our 3 days of using the system, my wife and I are very pleased overall.  We have a Play:3 setup in our master bathroom, a pair of Play:5's in our Master bedroom, and the other Play:3 in our living room.  It has been very nice playing music in multiple rooms and controlling from my phone.  I've tried a few of the internet radio stations and they work really well.  We've also enjoyed moving one of the Play:5's from our bedroom to the kitchen and other parts of the house.  That part is awesome!*** Sound Quality ***I'm no audiophile.  In my master bedroom, I previously had a Bose Wave Radio 2.  In my family room, I have a decent 7.1 surround sound system driven by an Onkyo A/V receiver paired with fairly decent speakers (can't remember the brand/model right as I'm typing this).  I also frequently use a nice pair of in-ear headphones, which probably give the best overall sound.  I have not been much of a music collector...I have maybe a few hundred songs accumulated over the years.  Most of these are ripped from CD's as I refuse to purchase MP3's with the current state of the music industry and DRM lock-in.  Thus when we play music, I either connect my phone with Slacker Radio or local MP3's directly to my Bose or A/V system.  Both acceptable.After reading the reviews for the Sonos, I had very high expectations for sound quality.  Perhaps inflated expectations is the problem.  But considering the cost of the system, high expectations are not unreasonable.  Unfortunately, the sound quality is just not there.  The overall experience is really good, but after 3 days, I'm getting more disappointed with the sound quality.  When paired together as a stereo pair, the Play:5's in our master bedroom are decent.  The lows and highs are acceptable.  Like someone else mentioned, there is a strange quality to the EQ settings for this system.  Perhaps it would be better if there were more EQ tuning options.  The system only has a Bass and Treble slider to mess with, which is not adequate.  Compared to my Bose, the 2 Play:5's paired together sound better.  Larger fuller sound.  However, if I unpair the speakers and use just one of the Play:5's, the sound is on par with the much smaller Bose system.  In fact, I think the Bose has a better high range than the Sonos.  The sound is not bad.  I'm sure someone will compare the sound/price to the Bose, which is fair.  However, I expected much more.  Another reviewer suggested getting a Z120 with external speakers is a better option and I have to say that is probably the better way to go for sound quality.In the bathroom, the single Play:3 is in vertical orientation and placed a few inches from the wall.  The wall does provide a much better bass response, so that is not the problem.  The problem is that these sound like background PA system speakers rather than nice audio speakers.  The sound is very focused on the midrange.  Even with the bass set all the way down and treble all the way up in the EQ settings, the upper mid's and high end range is just not there.  Since little speakers usually suffer from bad bass, my feeling is that Sonos really tuned these for lower ranges at the expense of the high ranges.  Have you ever been to a restaurant playing background music  (not live music) though a PA type system?  That is what these sound like.  The other day, I had some nice upbeat jazz playing while we were getting ready for a wedding.  As muted background music, these a fine, but that's about it.  I have a pair of outdoor Bose speakers in my pool area that are similar in size.  The Bose speakers are about the same depth and maybe a little longer.  The Bose are driven from my Onkyo A/V system and sound much, much better that the Sonos speakers.One final note on sound quality.  I have Slacker radio on my phone and have the subscription service that allows me to cache stations to my phone.  The common complaint is that cached stations on Slacker stream only at 60kbps - very low quality sound.  I tried connecting my phone to the input on one of the Play:5 systems and played a cached station.  I can't tell any noticeable difference between that and a 360kbps song playing from Spotify.  In my car, which has a nice audio system, playing a cached Slacker station sounds muddled.  In contrast, a downloaded track from Spotify sound like a CD, which is a notable difference in sound quality.  Unfortunately, the sound quality on Sonos is not good enough to hear the difference.*** Conclusion ***We love the functionality, but not the sound.  I'm going to play with the system a little more, but right now I'm leaning towards returning the components to Amazon.  Now that I know what full-house wireless sound is like, I'll start looking for alternatives.  Perhaps a good alternative is using Sonos 120's with external speakers, but that will be a little less convenient and more money.  I wonder what can be done with Apple Airplay?</td><td>1314489600</td><td>SONOS - PLAY:5 Wireless Speaker for Streaming Music (Large) -  White</td><td>A35KSV240RW1J0</td></tr><tr><td>B005PUSL8S</td><td>Rogz</td><td>List(0, 0)</td><td>http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41QgScFBMFL._SY300_.jpg</td><td>16.06</td><td>5.0</td><td>Works really good when you have the kind of dogs with no necks.i have 3 pugs and THIER neck is bigger then THIER head.</td><td>1360627200</td><td>Rogz Utility Medium 5/8-Inch Reflective Snake Adjustable Dog Step-in-Harness, Lime</td><td>AWDVZ98Z7IAXL</td></tr><tr><td>B00A4346VM</td><td>MPERO</td><td>List(0, 0)</td><td>http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41lTtN59JkL._SY300_.jpg</td><td>8.95</td><td>5.0</td><td>I will recommend this to anyone who needs this product.

That being said, I really love this stuff! I found that the fastest and easiet way to get it out of the jar is to simply take either a butter knife or spoon and just sort of chip or scrape some chunks and shavings out a little at a time.I make my own lotions and bath products, so I'll already have the cocoa butter premixed with something else to make it more 'manageable' as a hand cream before I head out. I take the cocoa butter pieces, add something like shea butter or an oil(coconut, mineral, EV olive, etc.), put them all in a glass and melt the entire mixture in the microwave. I than pour the mixture into a seperate travel size container, let it sit for about 30 minutes and voila! A very yummy smelling and heavenly hand and body cream!

I made my own training gear using a piece of 2&#34; x 2&#34; x 5/8&#34; piece of hardwood for the hub and 5/16&#34; dowels for the rods.  I reused the balls that came in this kit.  I quickly ran a 5/16 drill through the balls and they fitted securely on the ends of the dowels.  It works great and I've since had some extremely hard landings, but the wooden training gear doesn't break.  I paid just over $3.00 for this gear, so in my opinion, the balls are worth it.  It beats having to buy plastic balls and drilling/mounting them to the ends of the dowels.  That's why I give it 3 stars.

It will stay affixed to the seat in front of it and will hold a few light items, such as a juice box and bowl of finger snacks.  It is also sturdy enough to hold a small portable video player, having the screen size one finds factory installed in minivans.  It is too small for a laptop, which is what I purchased it for.  It is not large or sturdy enough to use as a table for coloring pictures.  Even with these drawbacks, it may still work for you.  Measure out the tray size to see if it's large enough for you and recognize that some of the clearance over the tray will be obstructed by the angle of recline of the front seat.  Good luck.</td><td>1259798400</td><td>Auto Laptop Tray Table</td><td>AO05JUUSXP7PT</td></tr><tr><td>B001E5E3C6</td><td>Erewhon</td><td>List(1, 1)</td><td>http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51pkPb7BM6L._SY300_.jpg</td><td>43.85</td><td>4.0</td><td>This is a very tasty gluten free cereal, but it doesn't offer much nutrionally in terms of protein and/or fiber.

It required no extra polishing.The handle feels comfortable, and the shape provides some protection against cuts. It's easy to slash your hand on a scraper edge as you burnish. That's why some expensive burnishers come with hand-guards. That is a good idea. However, I refuse to pay extra for a piece of machined brass. Instead, I just cut a chunk of wood or leather, put a hole in it, and slip it on the shaft. I prefer the leather-guard because I can make it very large to protect my entire hand, yet it folds-up compactly when I put it back in the drawer. For this burnisher, I don't even use that trick. The handle-shape is good enough.Unless you want a fancy machined hand-guard, or a specialty-burnisher for exotically shaped scrapers, this is one of the best bargains you'll find. It's simple, elegant and works great right from the box.There is NO functional difference between this economical burnisher and any of the fancier, expensive models. The traditional-design handle is pretty, easy-to-hold and fairly safe as-is.This is one of the few tools you can afford to spare-expense on without compromising performance.Highly Recommended!</td><td>1283126400</td><td>Crown 20260 Burnisher</td><td>A1TVFEIAK9EMID</td></tr><tr><td>B0081O93N2</td><td>NowAdvisor</td><td>List(0, 0)</td><td>http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41IA6SXVimL._SX300_.jpg</td><td>4.45</td><td>5.0</td><td>Does what it says it will, easy to read, easy to install, and easy to configure.

I understand the movie better now and it does make more sense, however it still suffers from major contradictions and holes. I really want to like this movie but I am stretching my judgement already. The deleted scene would have helped somewhat but it was cut out. Overall: Poor to Fair (Good if you have a six pack before watching this).
