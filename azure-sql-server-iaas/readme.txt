Topic:

Best Practicesfor SQL Server on an Azure VM


Abstract:

This presentation goes over key concepts that relate to both on the on premise and in cloud deployments.

Database processing involves CPU, RAM and DISK. I will go over engine settings and architectural choices that will help you get the most out of your Virtual Machine.

Even if you VM is configured to run extremely well, bad coding by the developers can cause performance issues. I will talk about using standard alerting for such identifying such conditions.
