New Backup Features in SQL Server 2014


Abstract:

Database administrators have been able to use transparent data encryption (TDE) since SQL Server 2008. However, backups are still saved in a format that anyone can read. This version of SQL Server now supports encrypted backups for those security conscious companies.

The data explosion of the 21st century has administrators concerned with where to save all those backups?
