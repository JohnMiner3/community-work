Copy the NE-DEV-UG folder to c:\.  Restore the backups into the .\data and .\log folders.

The tabular model SSDT project had issues using windows compression and copying.

In short, the path and file name where 2 long.

I used 7-zip to compress.  Download and install this version.

The .\projects folder contains the five different projects that I went over.
