Leveraging SQL Server data tools in VS 2017 


Abstract:

SQL Server Data Tools is a modern development tool that leverages the Visual Studio 2015 graphical interface.  
One can use this tool to build SQL Server relational databases, craft Integration Services packages, design 
Analysis Services data models, and deploy Reporting Services reports. 

During this talk, we will be working on a skunk works solution.  The business goals of this solution are to move data 
from a OLTP system into a STAR schema; create a report off the STAR schema; and deploy a tabular analysis service model 
for use with Power BI desktop.  A high level overview of each project type inside the solution will be explained.   

At the end of this talk, you will have a good understanding of the various project types that can be managed with this tool.
