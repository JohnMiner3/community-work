Topic:

Working with bit patterns.


Abstract:

In today’s manufacturing environment, production lines are automated with robotics and sensors. 
Many of these low end microprocessors and/or integrated circuits are designed for specific tasks such 
as temperature and pressure control. 

This presentation will review how to store the memory buffer in a table and use a view to interpret 
the results.


Coverage:

1 – Using the VARBINARY data type to store the bit pattern.
2 – Storing a version number just in-case the decode changes.
3 – Breaking the pattern into registers and nibbles.
4 – Left shifting of the bits.
5 – Right shifting of the bits.
6 – Combining bits from two registers.
7 – Putting it all together with a view.
