Background:

Microsoft has been working on self-service BI tools since the introduction of Power View for SharePoint 2010. All previous tools, Power Pivot, Power View, Power Query and Power Map, were add-ins to the MS Excel application. Thus they were bound to the MS Office software release schedule. Since changes are rapidly happening in the IT world, the Power BI offering was separated into the cloud offering and desktop designer. 

Just recently, Microsoft has release its latest desktop version from public preview in July 2015. The Power BI desktop designer can be downloaded from the following link. 
The designer is based upon Power Query to import data into the model. The x-velocity engine is used to save the data in a space saving format. The imported datasets can be related via relationships. The report visualizations can be categorized into different dashboard pages. This part of the designer is based upon Power View. 

If you have worked with Power Query and Power view in the past, you will be right at home.
